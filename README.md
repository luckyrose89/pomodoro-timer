### Dependencies

This project was made with HTML 5, CSS 3 & Javascript for the most part. However it depends on [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) v4.7.0 for displaying icons. The timer animation was created with the assistance of [Progressbarjs](https://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/), a lightweight library for responsive, animated progress bars. Both of these dependencies were bundled into the project folder.
